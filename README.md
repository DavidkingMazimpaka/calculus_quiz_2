# Assignment: Analyzing Quadratic Functions

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to implement a Python program that analyzes quadratic functions, computes derivatives, identifies critical points, and visualizes the functions.

## Tasks

### 1. Starter Code
Starter code can be found [here](LinkLinks to an external site.).

### 2. Write a Dynamic Function for Derivative Calculation
- Create a Python function that calculates the derivative of any given function with respect to a variable x.
- The function should take an input function f(x) as a string and return its derivative.
- Use SymPy or other suitable libraries for symbolic differentiation.

### 3. Test the Derivative Function with a Quadratic Equation
- Define a quadratic equation of your choice that has at least two minima and two maxima.
- Test the derivative function created in Task 2 with this quadratic equation to verify its correctness.

### 4. Plot the Graph of the Quadratic Equation
- Implement code to visualize the quadratic equation defined in Task 2.
- Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create a graph of the quadratic function.

### 5. Identify Minima and Maxima
- Create separate arrays to store the x-values of minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print these arrays to display the critical points of the function.

### 6. Compute Global Minima and Maxima
- Determine the global minima and maxima of the quadratic function.
- Print the coordinates of these points to identify the overall minimum and maximum values of the function.

### 7. Visualize the Global Minima and Maxima
- Plot the graph of the quadratic function along with markers indicating the global minima and maxima.
- Ensure that the markers are visually distinguishable on the graph.
